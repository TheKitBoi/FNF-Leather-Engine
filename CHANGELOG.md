# Changelog
All notable changes will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.7] - ?/?/????
### Fixed
- Freeplay crashing when loading a bunch of songs (with space bar) and then changing speed of song, and loading one.

## [0.3.6] - 11/6/2021
### Fixed
- Freeplay crashing when changing speed after closing song in freeplay or beating song and going back to freeplay (aka there was no bg music).

## [0.3.5] - 11/6/2021
### Added
- Hitsounds in the charter
- Rythm Input Mode (basically have to hit notes in order).
### Fixed
- Crash when ghost tapping is off (and you miss) and a modchart is active.
- Custom Difficulty Inst / Vocals not loading correctly when loading charter (because difficulty wasn't set before the audio was loaded).
- `mania` value in charts still existing after chaning things (basically it overrides `keyCount` and would glitch stuff).
- Rate / Song Speed being too fast (ie, if you were at 2x the health icon and camera zoom was higher than 2x).
- Discord RPC Song Time being glitchy.
