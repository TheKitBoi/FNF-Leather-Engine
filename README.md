This is the repository for Leather Engine, an engine created for making and playing mods for Friday Night Funkin'.

## Build Instructions 

### IMPORTANT:

IF YOU GET ANY ERRORS THAT SEEM TO RELATE TO `POLYMOD` (or `NULL OBJECT REFERENCE` / `VALUE EXCEPTION`) RUN `haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git` OR `haxelib update polymod` TO UPDATE POLYMOD (ERRORS USUALLY CAUSED BY OLDER VERSIONS).

For build intructions go to [Build.md](https://github.com/Leather128/LeathersFunkinEngine/blob/master/Build.md)

## Features

> 1-18 Key Support

What does this mean? Well, now if you want, you can choose a different amount of arrows / keys! (Aka different from 4), this feature only goes up to 18 however, because anything more than that would probably be too intensive and would use a lot of resources (also yes 1 key is a thing lol).

> Full mod support with Polymod (with a mod loader)!

Support for custom songs, characters, stages, weeks, cutscenes (dialogue, and video!!!! (lots of formats)), all without modifying the source code! All you have to do is follow a guide that I will be making in the future and then you can make as many mods as you want!

> Custom Cutscenes

Dialogue and video cutscenes can now be used without coding them in! (Although, in the future you will have the option to manually code them)

> Custom Note Types

You can have different note types that give different amounts of health or give damage on hit. They can be more advanced if you want however, since modcharts can access what note type the last note hit was.

> More to come...
